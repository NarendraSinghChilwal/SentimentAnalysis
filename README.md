# Amazon_Book_Review_SentimentAnalysis

This notebook performs sentiment analysis on a text dataset using Python. It covers data loading, text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and basic visualizations. The goal is to classify text (e.g., movie reviews, tweets, or any labeled text corpus) into positive/negative (or multi-class) sentiment categories.

## Contents

- **notebooks/TEXTDMML.ipynb**  
  - Loads a labeled text dataset (for example, a CSV of reviews or tweets).  
  - Cleans and tokenizes raw text (lowercasing, removing punctuation/stopwords, etc.).  
  - Converts text to numerical features using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.  
  - Splits data into train/test sets.  
  - Trains one or more classifiers (such as Multinomial Naïve Bayes or Logistic Regression).  
  - Evaluates model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.  
  - Optionally visualizes word-frequency distributions and performance metrics.

## Repository Structure

```
TextDMML_SentimentAnalysis/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── .gitignore
└── notebooks/
    └── TEXTDMML.ipynb
```

- **README.md**: This file—project overview, setup instructions, and dependencies.  
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python packages needed to run the notebook without errors.  
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and folders Git should ignore (e.g., cache files, checkpoints, raw data).  
- **notebooks/TEXTDMML.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing all code cells, narrative, and outputs.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone or download the repository**  
   The repository can be cloned from GitHub or downloaded as a ZIP archive. Once obtained, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate into the project folder.

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment**  
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Use Python’s built‐in `venv` module or your preferred environment manager. After creating the environment, activate it so that installations do not affect the system Python.

3. **Install project dependencies**  
   A `requirements.txt` file is provided in the project root. Install all required packages by running a pip installation command that reads from this file. This ensures you have the correct versions of libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

4. **Prepare your data**  
   - Create a `data/` folder at the root of the repository if it does not already exist.  
   - Place your labeled text dataset (for example, a CSV file named `sentiment_data.csv`) into the `data/` folder.  
   - In the notebook, verify that the data‐loading cell points to `data/sentiment_data.csv` (or whatever your file is called). For example:  
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv("data/sentiment_data.csv")
     ```

5. **Open and run the Jupyter notebook**  
   Launch Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) from within the activated virtual environment. In the file browser, navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open `TEXTDMML.ipynb`. Run each cell in order to reproduce the entire sentiment‐analysis pipeline. The notebook will display preprocessing steps, vectorization output, model training logs, evaluation metrics, and plots.

## Dependencies

All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. At minimum, this project uses:

- numpy  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- nltk  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

If any additional NLP libraries are used (such as spaCy or TextBlob), they should be added to `requirements.txt` before installation.

Example contents of `requirements.txt`:

```
numpy>=1.25.0
pandas>=2.1.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
nltk>=3.8.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
seaborn>=0.14.0
```

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file prevents accidental commits of large or sensitive files. A suggested `.gitignore` setup:

```
# Byte-compiled or optimized files
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Jupyter notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Ignore raw dataset files in data/ (don’t commit large CSVs)
data/*.csv

# Local virtual environment folders
venv/
env/
```

## Notes & Best Practices

- **Do not commit raw data**: Keep large datasets and any sensitive files (such as API keys or credentials) out of Git. Place them in `data/` and list `data/*.csv` in `.gitignore`.  
- **Credentials / API keys**: If the notebook fetches data from an external API or database, store API keys or connection strings in environment variables or a local configuration file (e.g., `.env`). Add that configuration file to `.gitignore`.  
- **Reproducibility**: Pin exact package versions in `requirements.txt` so that others can recreate your environment without version conflicts.  
- **Extending the project**: If you refactor preprocessing or modeling functions into standalone Python modules, consider adding a `src/` directory. For example:
  ```
  TextDMML_SentimentAnalysis/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── text_preprocessing.py
  │   └── model_training.py
  ├── notebooks/
  │   └── TEXTDMML.ipynb
  └── ...
  ```
